# EDA-H-1B-H-1B1-Visa-Petitions

Title : "Exploring 2019-20 Q3 H-1B/H-1B1 Visa Petitions" The Dataset is obtained from Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) (https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov) Discloure Data for "H_1B_H_1B1_E_3_FY2020_Q3.xlsx"

The H-1B visa category allows for "dual intent" where the foreign national will be coming to work in a professional position temporarily while also intending to immigrate to the United States.

The H1B1 visa applicant, however, has to demonstrate that he/she does not intend to immigrate to the United States.

Throughout the analysis, I will attempt to answer the following questions:

 What are the top occupations America needs the most?
 Who are the top employers that submit the most applications?
 Which employers pay the most for what job?
 Which states and cities hire the most H-1B visa workers?
